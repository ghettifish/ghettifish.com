    <h1 class="heading-2">Our Core Values</h1>
    <div class="text-block-2">You may own a bank, a coffee shop, a sheet metal plant, a repair shop, a web business, a band, a mission, an idea. Today you have the opportunity to be a light for more people in the world than your grandfather could ever dream of. It doesn&#x27;t matter where you are in the world, or what language you speak, you and your ideas can make the difference in people&#x27;s life. You&#x27;re not the only one. In fact there are tons of people who climb through their computer screens and yell as loud as they can to try and catch the attention of the &quot;right&quot; people. In a crowd of 7,000,000 people this is no easy feat. They are going to hire the &quot;Top Website Designers&quot; and the &quot;Best SEO Experts&quot;. They will want to get someone to help them on social media, and they will want to setup a channel on YouTube. The problem is that most of these companies are swooping in to make a quick buck on a modern day gold rush. These people forget to ask the question &quot;What is it for?&quot;. <br><br>Instead they plow ahead with their agendas: &quot;Of course you need a website, and we&#x27;ll even do you a favor by making it mobile friendly!&quot;, &quot; It&#x27;s only $2000 per month, and we can get you SO MANY LIKES&quot;, and &quot;Pay our company and you&#x27;ll be on the front page of Google in only 12 months&quot;<br><br>We are in the business of crafting identities for the folks who strive to pour every bit of their passion and personality into each crack and crevasse of their organization. Rather than yell at the top of our lungs, we keep our composure, and carefully build the representation of these companies and their missions. We aim for a final product that is the perfect expression of your org in its truest form. <br><br>How do we make this happen? By asking tons of questions.<br><br>We carve away and add dimension upon dimension by identifying your constraints, and fears, and strengths, and weaknesses. Then we meticulously transfer that pixel by pixel until we see you staring back at us.<br><br>Are you in love with what you do? Do you pour a part of yourself into your work everyday?<br><br>If you answered yes to either of those, and you want to go deep and attract people instead of yelling at them, fill out an application and see if we are the right fit for you.</div>
    <div class="text-block-2">We hear this all of the time: &quot;I need a website&quot;. This may come as a shock to you, but we don&#x27;t want to build a website unless we can prove that it&#x27;s actually a solution to your problem. It&#x27;s still amazing to us that companies charge thousands of dollars for a website as soon as anyone mutters the words.</div>
